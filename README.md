## Exam Slot Booking System
The Exam Slot Booking System is a web-based platform specifically designed to streamline and simplify the exam scheduling process at our college. It addresses the complexities of coordinating large student populations with diverse schedules, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual workload for both students and administrators.
## About
Tailored Chatbot for Hostel Booking System is a project designed to integrate a chatbot that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries to the hostel booking system. Traditional hostel booking processes are often time-consuming and involve manual searches and extensive communication with hostel staff. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an easy-to-use chatbot interface that assists students in addressing inquiries.

## Features
-User-friendly booking interface with real-time room availability updates.
-Secure user authentication and role-based access control for both students and administrators.
-Automated room assignment and slot allocation, reducing scheduling conflicts.
-Administrative dashboard for monitoring booking patterns and adjusting slot availability.
-Dynamic booking window configuration to handle different exam schedules and session types.
-Data encryption and JWT-based secure login system.

## Requirements
-Operating System: 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for full compatibility.
-Backend: Node.js and Express for the API, with MongoDB as the database for secure data handling.
-Frontend: React for the user interface to ensure a responsive and dynamic booking experience.
-Libraries and Frameworks: Use of JWT for secure user authentication and bcrypt for password encryption.
-Development Environment: Recommended IDE is Visual Studio Code with extensions for debugging and version control.
-Additional Dependencies: Includes Mongoose for MongoDB, React Router for page navigation, and Nodemailer for email notifications.
